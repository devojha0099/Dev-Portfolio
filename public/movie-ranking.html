<h1>The Best Web Series/Movies According to Dev</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Money Heist</h3>
<p>This is my favorite web series. When I started watching money heist, <br />I can't control myself so I binge watched it for 2 days. </p>
<h3>Sherlock Holmes</h3>
<p>I think this is the best movie of RDJ. Action,Adventure and thrill. <br />Make sure to watch all parts!! </p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption(1994)</h3>
<p>If you are down and out<br />
just watch this movie once if not above two.</p>
