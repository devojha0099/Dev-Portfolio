<h1>About Me</h1>
Hello!<br/> <p>I'm Devendra Kumar Ojha, a passionate and dedicated aspiring full-stack developer with a fresh perspective on technology. 
  I recently graduated with a B.Tech from the Institute of Engineering, Jiwaji University, Gwalior.</p>
 <p>My journey in the tech world began with a deep interest in Java and Data Structures,
   which quickly expanded to include web technologies like HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>I am currently honing my skills further by pursuing a comprehensive full-stack development course,
   aiming to master the art of creating seamless, user-friendly web applications. 
   With a solid foundation of 100 DSA questions under my belt, I'm not just about coding; 
   I'm about solving problems and optimizing solutions.</p>

<p>Outside of my coding endeavors, I enjoy challenging myself in hackathons and refining my strategic thinking through chess. 
  These experiences have taught me to approach problems creatively and persistently, both in technology and in life.</p>

<p>I'm excited to embark on this journey and eager to contribute my growing expertise to innovative projects. 
  Let's connect and create something amazing together!</p>
